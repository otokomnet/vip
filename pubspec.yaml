flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
  - img/bt_blue_ok.jpg
  - img/bt_tv_200.jpg
  - img/bt_buzdolabi_200.jpg
  - img/bt_sunroof_200.jpg
  - img/bt-sag-masa-200.jpg
  - img/bt-sol-masa-200.jpg
  - img/led1_ok.jpg
  - img/led2_ok.jpg
  - img/led3_ok.jpg
  - img/led4_ok.jpg
  - img/bt_exit_ok-200.jpg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/.

  # To add assets from package dependencies, first ensure the asset
  # is in the lib/ directory of the dependency. Then,
  # refer to the asset with a path prefixed with
  # `packages/PACKAGE_NAME/`. The `lib/` is implied, do not
  # include `lib/` in the asset path.
  #
  # Here is an example:
  #
  # assets:
  #  - packages/PACKAGE_NAME/path/to/asset

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
